# Another-Day-Scheduluer

## User Story

AS AN Student with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily 
planner SO THAT I can manage my time 
effectively
When I open the daily planner it shows 
the current time and day at the top and 
blocks for each hour of the day
So that I can click on a hour block and 
enter in a task for the time
When I view the time blocks for that day
Then each time block is color-coded to 
indicate whether it is in the past, 
present, or future THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
